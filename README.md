The two files in this repository are a simple subtraction problem generator and a pythagorean theorem problem generator. What they do is randomize a series of math problems and provide score reports after you end the program. 
I created two different problem generators using the same frame to demonstrate the different applications. The simple subtraction problem generator is a simple application, but the pythagorean theorem problem generator is a more complex application. I plan on creating a calculus problem generators after the Hackathon to test the versatility of the program's frame.
